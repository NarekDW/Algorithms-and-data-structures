# Exercise:

## Done:

1.1.5 Write a code fragment that prints true if the double variables x and y are both strictly between 0 and 1 and false
otherwise.

1.1.9 Write a code fragment that puts the binary representation of a positive integer N
into a String s.  
[Implementation: Exercises.java](./exercises/Exercises.java)

1.1.13 Write a code fragment to print the transposition (rows and columns changed) of a two-dimensional array with M
rows and N columns.

1.1.14 Write a static method lg() that takes an int value N as argument and returns the largest int not larger than the
base-2 logarithm of N. Do not use Math.  
[Implementation: Exercises.java](./exercises/Exercises.java)

1.1.15 Write a static method histogram() that takes an array a[] of int values and an integer M as arguments and returns
an array of length M whose ith entry is the number of times the integer i appeared in the argument array. If the
values in a[] are all between 0 and Mâ€“1, the sum of the values in the returned array should be equal to a.length.

1.1.20 Write a recursive static method that computes the value of ln(N!)   
[Implementation: Exercises.java](./exercises/Exercises.java)

1.1.22 Write a version of BinarySearch that uses the recursive rank() given on page 25 and traces the method calls.
Each time the recursive method is called, print the argu- ment values lo and hi, indented by the depth of the recursion.
Hint: Add an argument to the recursive method that keeps track of the depth.
