# Exercise:

## Done:

1.5.11 Implement weighted quick-find, where you always change the id[] entries of the smaller component to the
identifier of the larger component. How does this change affect performance?

1.5.12 Quick-union with path compression. Modify quick-union (page 224) to include path compression, by adding a loop to
union() that links every site on the paths from p and q to the roots of their trees to the root of the new tree. Give a
sequence of input pairs that causes this method to produce a path of length 4. Note : The amortized cost per operation
for this algorithm is known to be logarithmic.
